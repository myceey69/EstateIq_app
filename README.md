   ```bash
   cd EstateIQ_Flutter
   ```

2. **Get dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app:**

```

## State Management

Uses **Provider** pattern for efficient state management:
- `PropertyProvider` - Manages property list, search, and selected property

## Data

Currently uses demo data embedded in the app. To integrate with an API:
1. Create API service in `lib/services/`
2. Update `PropertyProvider` to fetch data from API
3. Add error handling and loading states

## Customization

### Colors
Edit `lib/theme/theme.dart` to customize the color palette.

### Properties
Edit `_initializeDemoData()` in `lib/providers/property_provider.dart` to add/modify properties.

### Screens
Edit screens in `lib/screens/` to customize layout and functionality.

## Development

### Run with specific device
```bash
flutter devices  # List available devices
flutter run -d <device_id>
```

### Enable web debug
```bash
flutter run -v
```

## API Integration (Future)

To connect to a backend:
1. Create `lib/services/api_service.dart`
2. Implement API calls in the service
3. Update `PropertyProvider` to use the service
4. Add error handling and loading states

## Performance Tips

- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Implement proper widget lifecycle management
- Use `Consumer` wisely to avoid unnecessary rebuilds
- Consider `Selector` for fine-grained state updates

## Troubleshooting

**App won't run:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

**Build errors:**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub cache clean
flutter pub get
```
